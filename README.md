# Synch_OpenQuotesChasing
Follow-up on open quotes with the click of a button. The Open Quotes Chasing Bot sends chase emails to clearance contacts based on user actions in a Google Sheet. Consists of two automations, 1 dispatcher which sends items (email information) to a queue, and 1 performer which reads items from the queue and executes sending.
